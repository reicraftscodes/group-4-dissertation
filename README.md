# Libraries and Tools Used


---
- Pandas – Used for data manipulation and analysis. Essential for reading and transforming structured datasets such as CSVs for facial emotion labels and features.
- NumPy– Provides support for numerical operations, especially with arrays and matrices. It is heavily used for preprocessing image data and handling numerical computations in deep learning workflows.
NumPy Documentation
- Matplotlib – A 2D plotting library used to visualize data distributions, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy/loss graphs), and confusion matrices.
- Seaborn– Built on top of matplotlib, it is used for enhanced data visualization. Helpful for producing attractive and informative statistical graphics such as heatmaps, pair plots, and correlation matrices.
- Python – The core programming language used throughout the project for scripting, modeling, and evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment for running experiments, visualizations, and documenting progress.


# Testing


---
Assert – Used to check that the data and functions work correctly during development. This helps catch errors early, such as mismatched shapes or incorrect values.
