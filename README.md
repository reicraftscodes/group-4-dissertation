# Multimodal Facial Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning Models
This dissertation project is a requirement for the completion of the Master’s in Artificial Intelligence degree at the University of the West of England, Bristol (UWE).

The complete detailed documentation for this project can be found on [GitBook documentation](https://university-of-the-west-england.gitbook.io/university-of-the-west-england-docs) and paper can be found [here](https://uwe-dissertation-paper.lovable.app/?utm_source=lovable-editor)

## Project Overview
This documentation covers the benchmarking of deep learning models for multimodal facial emotion recognition using RGB and thermal images. The objective is to compare model performance across different architectures and input modalities to improve the accuracy and reliability of emotion recognition systems.

Or you can run it via Google Colab.

##  How to run the project
To run the project, please follow the steps outlined below.

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://gitlab.uwe.ac.uk/lmr2-sanejo/group-4-dissertation
```

### Step 2: Select a branch name
The code implementations can be found in the following GitLab branches.

**Data augmentation**
- [data_processing](https://github.com/reicraftscodes/group-4-dissertation/tree/data_processing): Main branch for data preprocessing and augmentations.

**Models**
- [vit_model](https://github.com/reicraftscodes/group-4-dissertation/tree/feature4/vit_model): Vision Transformer implementations can be found on branch.
- [YOLO11](https://github.com/reicraftscodes/group-4-dissertation/tree/YOLO11): Yolo11 implementations can be found on branch.
- [CNN_Model](https://github.com/reicraftscodes/group-4-dissertation/tree/CNN_Model): CNN implementations can be found on branch.

### Step 3: Running the project
Check the **README.md** for how to run the model once you’ve checked out the branch and read further details in the [GitBook Documentation](https://university-of-the-west-england.gitbook.io/university-of-the-west-england-docs)
